_* previously known as WordPress Plug-in Observatory_

Welcome to HealthyWP project. We are thrilled you stopped by. If you are familiar with [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org), the Content Management System that powers 30% of the web, consider lending us a hand ;)

## What is HealthyWP?

HealthyWP aims to become a platform for crowd sourcing good and bad experiences on using or combining plugins in WordPress installations. The analysis of those experiences will be available openly via a user friendly portal, enabling them to build more effective and secure WordPress websites.

On a second level we intend on extending the platform to make use of state of the art software evaluation metrics to provide further information about the source code of the plugins themselves. This way we will help the authors of the plugins focus on usability, security and effectiveness as they extend or maintain them.


## Why WordPress?

WordPress platform has become a standard choice when it comes to Content Management Systems (CMS). Is is a Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) project which means is can be freely downloaded, used, altered and even sold (under the term of its [license](https://wordpress.org/about/license/)).

Moreover, a huge community built around it is responsible for more than 50.000 plugins, available also as FLOSS. Unfortunately not all WordPress plug-ins are “playing well” with each other, nor are properly maintained. Those conflicts sometimes extend to incompatibility with the WordPress version itself or the WordPress theme that is being used.


## Wanna help?

We will be honored to work with you! 

HealthyWP is an Open Source Software project, therefore, it will be difficult __not to find__ a role that suits your skill set.

### I __have__ a technical background:

We are working in creating a WordPress plug-in that will allow the users of our platform to send us their feedback. Moreover, in the same project we will be creating the platform that will host the data from the users. 

So if you have experience in back-end development, WordPress plug-in development or web development in general, your expertise will be invaluable :)

### I __don't__ have a technical background:

Great! Non-tech contributors are equally valuable for an open source project since they can help with [a great deal of things](https://opensource.com/life/16/1/8-ways-contribute-open-source-without-writing-code)! 

If you are a graphic designed, a UI/UX expert, a marketer, a translator, a lawyer, a WordPress advocate or user, please consider join us. You can really make a difference to our project's evolution.
